### A Route Between the 10 Best National Parks in the United States

For my final web mapping project I chose an article that discusses the 10 best national parks in the United States. This list was based on annual visitors and could be seen as subjective, however, if a magazine commissioned this article I would have to use it no matter what. Therefore, I used google my maps to construct a route across the country in order to visit all of these amazing parks. This route was then downloaded as a KML file and then converted to GPX and then to geoJson. I chose to use the bootstrap example on the class webpage and changed the background colors and font colors, etc. I then chose a basemap from leaflet. The basemap I chose was titled USGS.USTopo. I chose this map because it has a few labels throughout the country as well a few major roads and rivers when you zoom. It also does a very good job showing elevation and vegetation patterns throughout the country which I thought was important. The color of the route, as well as the park markers is a dark blue. I chose this color to compliment the color I chose for the header and footer. I left the location markers as markers and did not change them to a symbol because I felt this would be far too busy. Overall, I believe this map does a great job displaying this route as well as the areas around the country that it winds through.
